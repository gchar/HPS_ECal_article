# HPS_ECal_article

This repository is to be used by the members of the HPS collaboration
to share the work on the ECal article after 2015 runs.

It is here to optimize our work together. Only members having a significant
contribution to the article will be able to commit. 
For others, please send your comments to charles@ipno.in2p3.fr.
For points that would need a discussion, please raise it during a meeting.

TODO: Move the figures to a separate subdirectory instead of dumping everything in one dir.

TODO: Move to github.com/jeffersonlab/HPS-PUBS instead of a personal repo.
