We present here, the performances of the LED system. 

Typical signal shape (move to system setup?)

Analysis overview: events selection / LED turn-on effect

Typical pulse charge resolution: single histogram for a selected channel (map of the channels)

Short comment on LED radiation damage studies 

Short-term reproducibility: relative ratio of a single channel, (before-after)/before

Long-term stability
